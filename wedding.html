	 <p align="center">The Tahoe area means a lot to us, as we have spent some of our finest moments falling in love among these mountains. Sugar Bowl is a ski lodge by winter, but will be exclusively ours for our Summer wedding, making events very easy to find (trust us!). We hope you can join us here to take part in our joy as well as the beauty of the mountains.</p>

	<h1 align="center">Lodging Info:</h1>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Our update is basically we don't have an update</h2>
<p>Sugar Bowl has a smallish, on-site hotel, which will be blocked out for us.  There are also private houses on the property that will be rented out.</p>
<p>However, since those houses are privately owned, we will have to wait until the owners of those houses make their summer plans to see which ones will be rented out.</p>
<p>Sugar Bowl has told us that they generally find out which houses will be rented out <strong>around March</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the town of Truckee is very nearby.  There are many hotels, motels, etc there.  We will be looking into blocking out a hotel in Truckee, also.  This would probably be least expensive option.</p>

	<h2>Keep posted for updates...</h2>
