	 <p align="center">The Tahoe area means a lot to us, as we have spent some of our finest moments falling in love among these mountains. Sugar Bowl is a ski lodge by winter, but will be exclusively ours for our Summer wedding, making events very easy to find (trust us!). We hope you can join us here to take part in our joy as well as the beauty of the mountains.</p>

	<h1 align="center">Lodging Info:</h1>
<br>
<p>We have reserved the lodge at Sugar Bowl for the entire weekend (August 9 – 12). There are only
	27 rooms, so please email <a href="mailto:ashley.clark6@gmail.com?subject=Clark-Dziedziak%20Lodging%20Question">ashley.clark6@gmail.com</a> if you need a room and indicate which nights
you would like to stay. The rooms vary to accommodate single couples, families, or friends looking
to share a room. We will be working with the hotel to assign the rooms, so please be sure to
reserve your room as soon as possible.
You may also wish to stay in individual cabins or houses. We recommend staying &quot;on the summit&quot; in
Soda Springs or Norden, but you could also look down at Donner Lake or in Truckee. There are
also individual cabins located on the Sugar Bowl property. For these, please contact Sugar Bowl
resort directly or check out VRBO or AirBnB.</p>
	
<br>
<p>This is a link to a listing of some of the cabins available for rent on property.  This PDF link is not necessarily current (was current as of April 2018, but it is a small list and they may have been booked by the time you see it).  If you are interested in these cabins, please contact Sugar Bowl Resort to book them.</p>
	<p>These properties generally will make financial sense if you have a large group of people</p>
