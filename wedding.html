    <br>
	 <p align="center">The Tahoe area means a lot to us, as we have spent some of our finest moments falling in love among these mountains. Sugar Bowl is a ski lodge by winter, but will be exclusively ours for our Summer wedding, making events very easy to find (trust us!). We hope you can join us here to take part in our joy as well as the beauty of the mountains.</p>

<br>

<p>Donner Ski Ranch has a bar and grill that is the closest restaurant to Sugar Bowl. It’s located at the intersection between Old Hwy 40 and the driveway/road into Sugar Bowl (see above map). It is less than a mile away from Sugar Bowl. </p>

<p>If you want more options/have a car, we’d recommend going to Truckee. Truckee is the nearest major town, and it’s about 8 miles away. There are many restaurants, pubs, and shopping opportunities.</p>

<br>
	<h2 align="center">INDIVIDUAL CABINS/HOUSES</h2>
<p>You may wish to stay in individual cabins or houses. We recommend staying &quot;on the summit&quot; in
Soda Springs or Norden, but you could also look down at Donner Lake or in Truckee. There are
also individual cabins located on the Sugar Bowl property. For these, please contact Sugar Bowl
resort directly or check out VRBO or AirBnB.</p>
	
<br>
<p>This is a link to a listing of some of the cabins available for rent on the Sugar Bowl property.  This PDF link is not necessarily current (was current as of April 2018, but it is a small list and they may have been booked by the time you see it).  If you are interested in these cabins, please contact Sugar Bowl Resort to book them.</p>
	<p>These properties generally will make financial sense if you have a large group of people</p>

	<h2 align="center">TRUCKEE DONNER LODGE</h2>	
<p>At the East end of Donner Lake (right next to the Donner Party museum) sits Truckee Donner
Lodge. This venue is off of the summit, but <strong>we will be providing transportation to and from this
	lodge the day of the wedding.</strong> The discounted rates are $209 plus tax per night for a One King bed
room and $239 plus tax per night for a Two Queen bed room. Please tell Celeste that you are calling
	for the Clark-Dziedziak Wedding. A hot breakfast is included with the room.</p>

	<h2 align="center">DONNER SUMMIT RENTALS</h2>
<p>The condominiums are about a one mile walk from the Lodge at Sugar Bowl, and the houses on
Serene Lake are a few miles down the road. Please tell Sue that you are calling for the Clark-
Dziedziak Wedding and she will offer you a ten percent discount.  One drawback for these rentals is that <strong>sheets and towels are not included. (UPDATE: apparently sheets/towels can be rented for $15 per person, though I would suggest you confirm this when booking)</strong></p>

<p>This is a small five room bed and breakfast (two rooms are queen beds, two are queen + twin and
one family room with a queen and a set of bunk beds for kids under 18). August is one of the
busiest months of the year, so Paul encourages people to book early through their website. Queen
rooms are $169 per night, Queen + twin $179 per night and the family room is $189-$199 per night.
The rate includes parking, WiFi, hot tub, afternoon snack, and full hot cooked breakfast. Please tell
