          <p>After completing her first year in the MPP program at Berkeley's Goldman School, set off to spend her summer interning in Sierra Leone with a program sponsored by the Innovations for Poverty Action. While there, her primary interest is their program on Reconcilation, Conflict and Development in Sierra Leone. Check out their website <a href="http://www.poverty-action.org/" title="Innovations for Poverty Action">here</a> and the reconciliatin project <a href="http://www.poverty-action.org/project/0534" title="IPA Reconciation in Sierra Leone">here</a>.</p>
          <p>We don't have any photos of her trip to share yet: Internet connections in SIerra Leone operate at the speed of a slug. Be we do get the occassional email from her. Here are the first three:</p>

          Freetown so far<br>
          <strong>Sent:</strong> Thursday, May 31, 2012 12:52 PM</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Hello from  Sierra Leone,</p>
            <p>I have only  been here a week, but it feels like I have lived well beyond that.&nbsp;  Freetown is a brutal siege on your senses, demanding they work overtime to keep  up. One of my friends here says she can only have two or three senses going at  a time, and she often stops listening or smelling in situations. The colors are  bright and varied; people, cars, vibrant dresses, neon-colored school uniforms,  chickens, dogs, mopeds, and shopkeepers hawking used items are everywhere. Even  the dirt refuses to be calm, instead opting for a bright red color, and  whipping itself into the air, adding texture and substance to what your eyes  take in. In fact, the air is heavy with heat and emissions and smells of body  odor and rotting from every object, and the air barely has enough room for all  of the noise vibrating from everything. Chickens cluck, dogs bark, cars  constantly honk, and shopkeepers bargain. Sierra Leoneons are some of the  friendliest people I have ever met, and everyone seems to know everyone; add  that to the fact that they yell rather than talk, and the streets are clogged  with screaming friends. I, too, suffer from meeting and now knowing everyone  around our work; as I walk together ice cream or a snack, all the women yell  &ldquo;Asha Asha our friend! Hi friend!&rdquo; (so far, no one can say my name). The smells  vary from body odor to toxic to rotting to worse, and I always wish it were the  one scent I could lose.</p>
            <p>I arrived late  last Thursday in a madhouse that passed as an airport. The &ldquo;customs&rdquo; consisted  of two stalls, where people jostled in line begging to be let through. I then  was forced to flash my yellow fever card to an agent trying to control a mass  of moving people, but he quickly waved me on as I started to explain why I did  not have mine (it did not arrive in time). Every person there to pick up an aid  worker (UNDP, USAID, SNAP, etc) came up to me as I waited for my bags and asked  if I was Anne/Ruth/sleuth of western names. After getting my bag and hopping  the ferry to town, I was greeted by two of my coworkers, Evan and Josh. We  stayed up the first night watching NBA semi-finals, drinking, and getting  acquainted about the adventure ahead.</p>
            <p>On Sunday I  escaped the madness of Congotown (where I live) and headed twenty minutes by  car to No 2, one of the more remote beaches in Freetown.&nbsp; The beaches here  are stunning. Between the hours of 4 and 7 everything glows orange, and the  ocean becomes a sheet of pulsating diamonds. The sand is soft and the water is  so warm it makes the world melt away. On the beach, or in the water, everything  is calm especially in contrast to Congotown. My senses finally took a break,  smelling nothing but fresh salt air and watching the waves lap gently on the  shore. It felt surreal to be on such a beautiful beach with less than 20 people  after the madness of Congotown. I felt like I was cheating, sitting and  enjoying a beauty of Sierra Leone not everyone in my neighborhood would get to  see. </p>
            <p>We sat on the  beach under umbrellas being served beer until Evan and Sam decided to play  Frisbee. Within five minutes we had made friends with three little boys, who  asked if they could be our friends. We gave them water and joked with them,  excited to have some new friends.&nbsp; On the way back we stopped at a  restaurant on the beach and ate while the sunset. We were served Carpachio, and  it was a fish they caught as soon as we arrived at the place.&nbsp; The fish  dissolved on your tongue and the sun dissolved behind the sparkling ocean. Evan  and Josh made friends with a dog, who wanted to play Frisbee with them.</p>
            <p>Even though it  has been less than a week, I feel as though I already have a million stories,  all of which are concurrently mundane and epic; mundane in how they involved  ordinary actions, and epic due to their settings. For lunch on my first day we  went to an alley by the office and four of us stuffed ourselves into a tin and  cardboard shack (this is not literary license- the shack had cardboard recycled  from boxes on spots where the tin had rusted away). It is already hot in Sierra  Leone, but it is even hotter in a tin shack with a hearth going. I felt like I  was in a steam room in a gym, except instead of wearing a towel I was in a  button down and appropriately long skirt. We ate a fish stew prepared by a  incomprehensible woman, and we hunched over the main bench so tightly packed  like sardines that even her little child had to wait right outside the doorway.  He, of course, stared and smiled at us the entire time we ate.&nbsp; The fish  stew cost was lava-spicy, so an already hot day became even more ridiculous.  When I left, pleasantly full with the tasty food, I felt like a towel that had  been completely rung of all of its water.</p>
            <p>I live in a  three-story house with an NGO on the bottom floor and a family of at least 7  children on the top floor. We have two dogs, an 11 month old named Miss Jack  and a 2 month old named Snoopy. Miss Jack belonged the IPA worker who used to  live in my room, and she found him outside her door one day. She is wonderful,  and always runs around me when I get home. Unfortunately, one of the children  dropped her from the third floor about a month ago, so she can only really use  three of her four legs. She is a good cuddler, as is her friend, Snoopy.&nbsp;  I live with two girls named Sam, which affords me the opportunity to call them  &ldquo;the Sams,&rdquo; which I find way more entertaining than anyone else.</p>
            <p>The office is  nice enough, and only a twenty-minute walk from my home. &nbsp;The people are  great, but we all work from around 830 am to 7 everyday (and sometimes we bring  home work). The office is a mix of Sierra Leoneans and ex-pats, and everyone is  insanely friendly and kind. Luckily there are quite a few people able and  willing to show me the ropes around here, and I am excited to do even more  exploring. </p>
            <p>And with that,  I am off to bed. One of the Sams and I go to the UN gym every morning, which  has &ldquo;air conditioning&rdquo; (ie kept at 80 degrees instead of 90), and therefore is  the only place I am physically able to go running in the mornings.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Much love from  Salone (what they call Sierra Leone here)</p>
            <p>Ashley</p>

              Five days without  running water<br>
        <strong>Sent:</strong> Monday, June 18, 2012 6:05 AM</h2>
            <p>Nothing is ever  easy in Sweet Salone. This is one of my new sayings, and I already have  everyone at the office saying the aphorism. Whether it be getting a generator  fixed (a two week ordeal that involved a new drama everyday) to visiting a  friend&rsquo;s house (up a harrowing hill that requires a motorbike, which is  something I promised myself I would not take) to paying a tab, nothing is ever  easy. For a country whose development has stalled since the 1960s (the GDP per  capita is lower now than it was then, a fine distinction even for an African  country), this country is constantly moving. The people, the bikes, the flies,  and the time. As such, nothing is ever easy- contracts are constantly being  negotiated, roads are constantly under construction but never finished, and  obstacles are constantly moving into your path as soon as an old one  disappears.</p>
            <p>And then our  water stopped running.</p>
            <p>To many people,  this may seem like a minor inconvenience. In fact, even for me, I never thought  running water was entirely necessary. I could go camping for a week without  running water! So you get dirty, so what. From this past week, there are three  main contentions I have with my own pre-judgment of my situation. First, one  expects no running water in the woods. However, one expects running water in a  city, let alone the capital of a country. You are not expected to look dirty  when you work, and you are expected to have clothes and clean underwear.  Secondly, one can&rsquo;t wash dishes without running water. The lack of water was not  discovered until after we had cooked dinner, leading us to the frightening  decision of &ldquo;what to do with the dishes until the roaches come.&rdquo; They always  come. Combined with the lack of places to eat, and the pittance of a salary  supplied here for eating at the places that do offer food, this was a  frightening prospect for every minute the tap would not turn on. Thirdly, in  the woods, one is with nature. When nature calls, you can have your pick of  tree, bush, or rock. In the city, when nature calls&hellip;</p>
            <p>What happens in  the five days when one&rsquo;s water stops running in a country that never stops?</p>
            <p>On the first  day, I found myself in one of my books. A rare down-day, a few friends and I  spend the day in Oasis, an ex-pat caf&eacute; aptly named for being one of the quiet  places in all of Freetown.&nbsp; My friend Katy sees a tall, slightly weary  looking white man at the table next to us and calls him over. He only asks  after Katy&rsquo;s well-being, waiting to be introduced. It was there that his  British politeness ended, and he asks us questions, only to follow up with a  long, ornate, and enthralling story about the subject that came before. It was  clear; he is a journalist. His stories are fascinating but detached, and I both  hang on his every word and hate the air around him when he speaks. I do not  know when in the conversation I realize it, but I had seen this entire scene  before. I had seen the ex-pats, a collection of Brits, South Africans, Aussies,  Hungarians, Mexicans, and Lebanese, sitting at the Oasis, the NGO workers, those  aiding the current regime, and the flippant war journalist. I had seen this  scene in the multiple books I had read, the books about Bosnia, Rwanda,  Vietnam, Sudan, and Democratic Republic of Congo. I was sitting in a clich&eacute; I  had read about, had dreamt about, and it felt odd. I am still trying to figure  out how I feel about it- to say I feel bad or negative in anyway about this  would be a lie, but to say I look back on it positively would also be a farce.  I guess that is the burden of my generation- self-awareness with no idea what  to do with it.</p>
            <p>On the second  day I discover that the rainy season is not just the rainy season here in SL:  we are entering the &ldquo;hungry season.&rdquo; In the coming two months, 98% of rural SL  will run out of food staples, such as cassava and rice. One in four children  will miss school because of the lack of food at home. Many farmers resort to  eating their own seeds, which will only increase the cycle of poverty and  hunger. I stop complaining about not being to eat cheese for the three months I  am here.</p>
            <p>On the third day  I took my first African dance class. Six white females from the UK, Australia,  Hungary, Poland, and Austria headed to this dance studio in downtown Freetown.  The studio is small and cramped, lined with uneven wooden planks that creak and  groan as you walk down them.&nbsp; Two old pianos, which look as though they  came over in 1940, and sound as though they haven&rsquo;t been tuned since, wear  placards that beg you to &ldquo;be gentle with her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our instructor is a compact  Sierra Leonean, as black as we are collectively white, and all the ex-pats know  and joke with him. We remove our shoes and pound on the wooden slats as he  looses us up. He has come up with a routine for us, easy enough that it can be  performed by six women, only one and a half of whom have any rhythm or talent.  As we no longer have NPA (or power), we practice into the dark, never pausing  for water but constantly moving and dancing and jumping and swimming. Around  sunset, another class is let out, and the children all come to laugh at the  whites dancing. They stand in the doorway at first, and then slowly work up the  courage to follow behind us, doing our moves more perfect than we can ever  dream. The class devolves, and a woman from the back yells at our dance teacher  for not teaching us &ldquo;the real African moves.&rdquo; She leads us in an impromptu  lesson, and quickly has us all rolling on the floor and on all fours doing  dance moves that might make even Madonna blush (singer not virgin). The  children laugh, and by the time the class is over it is pitch black and I can&rsquo;t  even see my own tan bag I need to leave.&nbsp; We thank and pay our original  instructor, and make our impromptu female instructor promise to come back and  teach us some more moves. We then all pile into Allie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Save the Children&rdquo;  branded jeep and giggle the whole way home about our recital (which might be  sometime in July).</p>
            <p>On the fourth  day I realize how to make small talk in Sierra Leone. In the States, and  elsewhere in the world, weather is a good conversation starter. In SL, where  the days fluctuate 3-4 degrees, it is best not to talk about it. However, the  main topic in Sierra Leone- NPA, or National Power Association.&nbsp; There are  two power plants in SL, one for the miners, and one for the rest of the country.  This one for everybody else also happens to be a hydropower dam, which makes  sense during the rainy season, but is not as logical the other 10 months. Power  outages are frequent. Again, this would be usual in a developing country, and  not surprising, if this were not the power for the entire country. Even the  capital of the country cannot even guarantee its own power. So, in SL, you talk  about NPA. &ldquo;We have had NPA for ten whole hours!&rdquo; my coworker Alpha once said  to me. &ldquo;We have had NPA every day this week!&rdquo; Alex, another SL I work with,  started a conversation with me in the hallway. &ldquo;The fan has not been on for six  hours. I hope NPA comes back soon,&rdquo; I now begin with Fatu, my SL deskmate. She  nods approvingly, and we begin a conversation.</p>
            <p>On the fifth day,  the water came back. After a day in Pizet, the market for Lapas and fabrics  (more on fabrics in another installment), the Sams and I came back to our  apartment hot and sweaty and looking for a break. I flop down on the couch and  a few seconds later hear cries from Other Sam. I run into the kitchen and the  water is running. We both scream and dance around our kitchen, pouring water  all over our dirty dishes, and then rushing to the bathroom to flush the toilet  as many times as possible. We then turn our music up as loud as it can go and  have the longest buckets of our lives (I refuse to call them showers- you take  water out of a bucket and dump it on yourself.) Dirt rushes off my body, no  matter how many times I pour, the constantly moving water is always brown.  After a good half an hour the water slowly becomes clear, and I finally have  pale legs and feet. Even though I am still dirty by even my own lax American  standards, I have never felt so clean in my entire life.</p>
            <p>I hope you are  all having a clean Monday.</p>
            <p>Cheers,<br>
            Ashley</p>

              <p><br clear="all">
                Last week was easily my  favorite week so far in Sierra Leone. The office is going through a huge  transition, and many of the staff who have been here for a year or two are  leaving. Last week we said goodbye to Evan, one of the people who picked me up  from the ferry, as well as two other amazing coworkers. The festivities began  at work with a &ldquo;Sierra Leone Saloon,&rdquo; which involved every single person  standing and making a speech about the three departing coworkers. It was  amazing to see how close the entire office was, and that 30 people, from those  who guard the front gate to clean the floor to manage the entire office, could  all say such lovely things about one another.&nbsp; Although the full 2 hours  of speeches were amazing, one speech in particular was especially moving-&nbsp;  Alpha&rsquo;s. Alpha is my age, but when I was getting braces put on my teeth and  entering sixth grade, Alpha was a soldier in the RUF, the rebel army in Sierra  Leone during the civil war. After the war, he studied for five years under  Father Franco to be a priest, but after he got his girlfriend pregnant, he had  to stop that path. He is an avid reader, and has read all the books dealing  with IPA and its mission. Alpha was one of the first to volunteer to talk. &ldquo;My  beautiful country cannot thank you enough, thank you all enough.&rdquo; Through his  thick krio accent, I could not understand all of the words he was saying, but I  understood all of his sentiment.&nbsp; It is hard to try to explain something  in words, when the exact words Alpha used were not important. It was how he  said the things he tried to say, the conviction, the passion, the desperation  and immediacy of trying to thank people for volunteering to help, help his  country help itself, figure out a way to make lives of his fellow countrymen  better. As he continued, his gratitude spilled upon us all, and everyone&rsquo;s eyes  became wet.</p>
              <p> &nbsp;After  the speeches, we had a dance party in the office, followed by a surprise for  the leaving ex-pats: a poda poda. A poda poda is a small van- think emptied out  Volkswagen bus with four rows of chairs. It is impossibly small, and the hard  benches fit four to a row. You can&rsquo;t actually rest your legs forward, so you  end up lifting them up off the ground and resting your knees on the bench in  front of you the entire ride. You can&rsquo;t turn them to the side, because another  body is there. We fit 20 people in the poda poda, and then the armada of two  bikes, one poda poda, and one passenger car went off to the bars. We went from  bar to bar, causing a stir whenever we showed. DJs would announce the arrival  of us, this crazy mix of whites and Sierra Leoneons, who all danced so very  differently and yet seemed to know the words to every song. My coworkers taught  me how to sing Rihanna songs in Krio (&ldquo;Wha na ma name&rdquo;). They played my favorite  SL song at every bar, which I suspect was the work of one of my coworkers, who  I had admitted to earlier in the day that the song was stuck in my head for a  week. Each bar we went to, a small crowd would gather at the edge of the bar,  children and adults alike, who laughed at the way we enjoyed the evening. The  festivities lasted until 6 am, and involved some late-night ocean swimming.</p>
              <p> &nbsp;That  Friday I got my first opportunity to go up-country, which is the term used for  basically leaving the peninsula of Freetown. I travelled with my coworker Fatu  to a small village outside of Makeni. The embarkation point to anywhere off the  peninsula is called &ldquo;the Shell,&rdquo; after the shell station that used to be there.  The trip to this station is almost as long as the trip to Makeni, due to the  terrible state of Freetown roads and traffic. As soon as we were halfway across  town, the sky opened up. We quickly sought refuge in a church awning, among  many other trapped spectators. We watchedn as the streets became orange rivers  that looked like 1960s Technicolor water from a movie about biblical rain, as  if they had been painted in post-production to be more vibrant and surreal. I  bought a SL flag umbrella, which promptly leaked all over. Fatu looked at me,  laughed, and repeated &ldquo;nothing is ever easy in Sweet Salone.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;We  finally reached shell, and got into a bus (think your mom&rsquo;s miniwan, but  sitting four to a row, and those four people are adults) and headed to Makeni.  Makeni&nbsp; is another city in Sierra Leone, closer to where minerals are  mined. &nbsp;On the way, the bus, the two rows of four (and three in the front  seat, which meant two in the shotgun seat), became animated. &ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; the  driver said pointing wildly at the window. Everyone leaned into the windows  (and over me), and Fatu smiled proudly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;See that there,  the train??&rdquo; I saw an old, rusted, large train bumbling along in the distance.  &ldquo;The train?&rdquo; Yes!&rdquo; Fatu exclaimed, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t is beautiful? It is the first working  train in Sierra Leone for over 30 years. It is carrying African minerals for  the mining company&rdquo; She paused, before adding &ldquo;I have never seen a train  before. That was my first time.&rdquo; I did not know what to say, having trains been  such a common part of my life for four years, when I was lucky enough to take  one everyday around DC, or a longer one to go home to Philadelphia. I  remembered bemoaning the lateness of the metro, the delays on the red line, the  constant construction on orange. How did I not constantly marvel at what  worked, at the plethora of trains in my country, of the ease to get from one  place to another? After some silence, she said &ldquo;Maybe, one day, they will have  trains with people on them. I would like to ride it then.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;We  arrived in Makeni, which is much smaller than Freetown, and as much of a city  as Burlington, VT. We woke early the next morning to take okados, or  motorbikes, up to the small village where we would be monitoring the  intervention. We hailed my driver for the day, Moses, a cool Makenian with  black ray bans that were stylish among American hipsters and a puffy jacket. It  was 80 degrees, and he wore a puffy jacket. We raced between the hills on his  okado, often straying from the road when the potholes became oppressive and  flying through rural villages with thatched huts, scattering chickens and  avoiding hanging clothing. The children would start chanting &ldquo;apato&rdquo; when they  saw me fly through, and I would try to wave, while desperately clutching onto  Moses.&nbsp; Moses mocked me for shaking like a leaf on the back of the okado.  &ldquo;I will teach you how to drive the okado, then you will not be scared.&rdquo; I  politely declined. I was aware of the heavy symbolism of a man named Moses  leading me on this sojourn, but I feared that if he tried to teach me to drive,  we really would be stuck somewhere for forty years.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;We  got to the village, a tiny place with a government hospital. The hospital, no  more than 3 rooms made of brick, serves eleven villages. We hiked to see the  construction of a bridge by the river, which would finally connect the hospital  to many of the villages during rainy season. I met the architect of the bridge,  who stood up very straight when he told me &ldquo;it is the longest and tallest  bridge designed by an indigenous in all of Sierra Leone.&rdquo; We then headed back  to the meeting.<br>
  &nbsp;The  meeting involved stakeholders of the various villages, coming together to  identify the biggest health issues in their community, action items various  actors could take to try to overcome these issues, indicators of implementation  of the actions, and deadlines. It was not my first town hall meeting, but it  was my first in Sierra Leone. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;I  have this running joke, mostly with myself, that Sierra Leone is just like  Vermont. I was walking home in the dark one day (no street lights, and mostly  no lights) and was very adept at moving around. I thought &ldquo;I guess I am so good  at moving in the dark because of living in Vermont for so long. Vermont is a  lot like Sierra Leone in that respect,&rdquo; to which I started laughing out loud of  the absurdity of this thought. I tried to explain to Sam why it was funny, but  it took 30 minutes to explain &ldquo;VT is 98% white&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is always cold there&rdquo;  and such to get her to understand how UNLIKE Vermont it is here.&nbsp; It comes  up at random times, both as a facetious joke, but also as a semi-true statement.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;I  could not help think of it during the town hall meeting. At one point an okado  driver stood up, asking that the community pool money to buy an ambulance. He  was not well equipped to handle hurt and dying patients, and the roads did not  allow him the speed necessary for sick people. &nbsp;I could not stop thinking  of the famous Normal Rockwell portrait of the poor farmer speaking during a  Vermont town-hall meeting, wearing slightly grungy clothes and grasping onto  his hat. How would he paint this man, this dark Sierra Leonean, with a black  used polo and matted hair? Would the light highlighting the man&rsquo;s face look  different, as it was not filtered through glass on the wall? How would he find  the dress of the fellow villagers, the women with bright and tattered lapas and  headwear, the men forgoing crumpled 1940s suits in favor of used shirts that  said names of American towns and English football team? How would he paint such  a scene? Would it be jus like Vermont?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;During  the meeting, a group of young children from the village had gathered outside my  window to stare at me. One child became two, two became four, and so on until  there were seven outside giggling and pointing. I walked outside to talk to the  head of the meeting as they rushed in to grab my coke can I had left at the  seat. I walked up to them afterwards and asked if I could &ldquo;snap photo.&rdquo; Some  smiled, some posed, and one posed with my coke can, pretending to drink it.  They loved looking at themselves, and no matter what pose they were in, they  would laugh and point at their photos when I showed them. When I went to leave,  and hoped on Moses&rsquo; okado, they gathered round and kept trying to use the few  English phrases they knew.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;I  returned to Freetown that night, full of pinched nerves and swollen legs from tight  cars and long okado rides. &nbsp;I fell asleep promptly at 10 only to awake  before sunrise to head down to the southern tip of the peninsula for a hike  with Grant, Katie, and Jessica. We stopped at a small village called &ldquo;Big  Water&rdquo; and asked for a man that had led a previous group of ex-pats on a hike  six months back. The man called another villager forth, an older man with a  ripped shirt exposing his bellybutton and a large, rusted machete.&nbsp; He led  us through the village, past the goats, one brick house, and thatched huts to  the trail.&nbsp; We asked him to lead us to the top of Picket Mountain, the  largest mountain on the peninsula.&nbsp; Usman, our guide, took us on a flat a  walking path for about a half an hour, where we passed a few groups of men climbing  the trees to harvest palm oil. The trail then became thick with brush and  trees, mangroves, and ferns covering the path and clawing at our clothes. The  brush became so thick that Usman had to cut down branches and vines just so we  could progress. We saw tiny monkeys flying through the air. We heard giant  thumps, to which Grant explain ed how baboons thump the base of trees to make  the bananas and other fruits fall. &ldquo;Just like Donkey Kong!&rdquo; I exclaimed to  puzzlement of everybody. Apparently video game references are not universal.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;We  passed by the remnants of an old village. The Portugese had used the village as  a embarkation point, and had even built a prison on the spot, which still  stood, albeit with a tree growing on the top of the now absent roof. &ldquo;Apato  actually comes from &lsquo;of portugal&rsquo;&rdquo; Katie told us, as we posed in the empty  window frames of the old prison. A faint remnant of a market stood next to the  old building, although it was much more recent. &ldquo;See the rails sticking there?&rdquo;  asked Grant, pointing to some oddly placed railway tracks sticking up next to  trees or along the path. &ldquo;The British left a train to upcountry in the 1960s.  The train was dismantled, and people used the tracks to build houses, and this  here market.&rdquo; I stared at amazement as we continued on. &ldquo;Freetown was actually  easier to get around in the 1960s then it is now&rdquo; Grant said as Usman hacked a  path for us through the crumbling rocks and jungle vines. &ldquo;This, below us, used  to a be a road. The bridges we came over driving here- they were built in the  1960s.&rdquo; Grant went on to explain that Sierra Leone used to export the most  educated Africans to other parts of Africa, as well as various countries around  the world. Sierra Leone used to be known for its doctors, teachers, and  engineers.&nbsp; I kept thinking of the railway tracks in the middle of the  jungle. History, corruption, and war, it seemed, had done to the Sierra Leoneon  public what those in the 1960s had done to the tracks. They taken their path to  economic success, their population, and repurposed them in the jungle,  misallocated them to steal from them, to fight each other. Now they stood,  still proud and mighty, in the jungle, waiting for the next task.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;Our  guide had gotten lost, and we never reached the summit of the mountain but we  returned to our car six hours later and headed to Bure beach. I have never been  to a beach as beautiful as Bure. The mountains, the impossibly lush, green,  fertile mountains, as green as pine trees but with leaves and an almost velvety  feel, plunged into the bright white sand which flattened out before meeting the  sparkling ocean. Scattered about were large rocks, about the size of small  dolphins, and the color of the horizon after a winter storm. A large river  emptied out into the beach, and the current of the river was quick as it  brought warm water to the ocean. We sat in the rushing river like children,  pretending to be super heroes as we laid on our stomachs and the current pushed  as back into the ocean, before burying our butts into the sand and enjoying the  jet stream massage. We then let the waters take us into the ocean, which was  decidedly colder, but still warmed than the Atlantic in August. I was told  there were two camps: those who preferred beach NO. 2, and those who preferred  Bure. I think Bure might be one of the most beautiful places in the world, I  told Katie while bobbing in the waves. I am definitely a Bure person.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;On  the way back to Freetown, we dropped Grant off at Waterloo. Grant has opened a  business with his SL friends to make beautiful belts out of lapas and SL  fabric. The buckles are made by iron workers in a polio clinic out of old cars,  and Grant was stopping to interview some of the workers for the belt&rsquo;s website.  We proceeded along a mountain path on a notoriously bad SL road. We saw a  little girl who waved us down, and as we were between villages, we stopped,  offering her a ride. She hopped in he car with her two sisters, and quickly  started talking to us an asking questions. She put her arm around Jessica, who  was in the backseat, and stroked and petted her. We asked them where they were  headed, and they explained they were off to their father&rsquo;s as their mother, who  was in a few villages over, had just died. The girls did not seem upset though,  I think excited to be in a car, let alone with three foreigners. She asked us  for our numbers (most precocious ten year old ever). At one point there was a  faint lull in the conversation, so she said &ldquo;you two in the front, you are sexy  babes,&rdquo; to which we could not help by collapse in laughter. &nbsp;We dropped  the children off at their house, and heard many krio &ldquo;thankees&rdquo; as we drove  back into the bustling madness of Freetown.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;This  email has gotten very long, and it is time for me to fall asleep. I hope all is  well with everyone, and I miss everyone like crazy. The beaches help me through  the pain, though.</p>
              <p> Cheers<br>

      <li class="story style16"> Amy and Roger teamed up to co-teach International Business  Transactions?&nbsp; A great way to get a  teaching gig in London for five weeks and go as a team! Here's a picture taken at the bank of the Thames of our USD London crew:</li>

      <li class="story style16"> Grace and Melissa trekked east from DownUnder to spend several  days with the clan (minus Amy and Roger who were in London). Melissa &nbsp;was attending a conference in Nashville, but got to spend time  with Seymour and co (Carolyne, Philip, Charlotte, and Isabella) in Philly. She and Grace spent a spectacular 4th of July with  Ashley in DC.&nbsp; Photos here&hellip;.</li>
      <li class="story style16">Ashley  and her friends formed a rock band on Ashley&rsquo;s new wii, and debated going pro  for a while before everyone decided they liked their cushy NGO salaries  better.&nbsp; </li>
      <li class="story style16">Ashley was given a promotion at  <a href="http://www.heinzctr.org/">The Heinz Center</a>, and is now the Communications and Development Associate.</li>
      <li class="story style16">With raise in hand,  Ashley quickly flew off to Kampala, Uganda, with her father to attend the 7 year  Review Conference on the International Criminal Court.&nbsp; Ashley reported sighting many baboons between  meetings. It was not all work,  though - Roger and Ashley were able to squeeze in a safari in Queen Elizabeth  Park, complete with hippos, water buffalo, elephants, human-sized lizards, every bird imaginable and  even lions! Ashley was able to also fit some chimps into her busy schedule,  seeing them on an Ngamba island, a Jane Goodall project.&nbsp; For pictures of their safari  trip (and other memorable moments) click here.</li>
      <li class="story style16">Roger blew out his 70  birthday candles in London with his grandson, Rupert, Rupert&rsquo;s girlfriend  Hayley, and his daughter Ashley. Ashley and Roger were returning from the ICC Review Conference in Kampala, where they were part of the Samaoan delegation.</li>

      <li class="story style16">        Some years it is the year of graduations; others the year of  births. This year was the year of &ldquo;moving&nbsp;  up&rdquo; celebrations: Aviv &ldquo;moved up&rdquo; from kindergarten to first grade, and  Philip &ldquo;moved up&rdquo; from pre-school to pre-K.&nbsp;  The rest of us just got older.</li>
      <li class="story style16">        Also the year of reunions &ndash; two of them &ndash; for Amy.&nbsp; Forty years since her graduation from&nbsp; Bryn Mawr, and thirty-five since Rutgers Law  School.&nbsp; Click here for some&nbsp; before and (yikes!) after pictures.</li>
      <li class="story style16">Roger, as usual, has been on the move. In addition to London with Amy, he has been to Lisbon, for the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law; to
        Istanbul  to speak on Capital Punishment; and to Salzburg Austria for the Summer School on International Criminal Law.</li>
      <li class="story style16">        In April, Ashley, Amy and Roger did a 6K Run for Water Live Earth outside DC for water projects in Haiti. &nbsp;(Somebody figured out that women in developing&nbsp;countries walk an average of 6k a day to fetch and carry water.) Ashley finished with a PR, Roger won his age  group, and Amy so injured her foot in walking the distance that she hasn&rsquo;t been  able to walk right since!</li>

      <li class="story style16">In February, Ashley moved from Columbia Heights  to a cute apartment in Logan Circle, where she is now surrounded by trees,  puppies, and independently owned coffee shops. </li>
      <li class="story style16">In May, Ashley,  along with two of her college friends Christine Neeb and Meg Young, raced in  the legendary Philadelphia Broad Street Run. They were able to raise over $3,000  for the Sarah LeCates Memorial Scholarship, an award dedicated to the memory of  Sarah LeCates which is given to a graduating senior at Haddonfield Memorial  High School who embodies Sarah&rsquo;s zestful  spirit, her passion for service and her global outlook. Described by her older  sister as &ldquo;the finest example of human being-ness&rdquo;, Sarah was an active member  of the Haddonfield community who gave selflessly of herself for the good of the  community.        </li>
      <li class="story style16">In  the fall of 2009, Ashley ran both her first and second half marathon. The  first  was the Rock And Roll Half in Virginia Beach, VA, with Meg Young and Dan  Knowlton. In the second, the Philadelphia Half Marathon,  she bettered her time by  over ten minutes! (She kindly asked neither of her times be displayed, in order  to protect everyone&rsquo;s dignity). Her friend Kathryn Babin was injured shortly  before the Philadelphia race, and her number was worn by Chris Pellicia, who ended up  finishing third among women.&nbsp; Too bad he  was male!</li>
      <li class="story style16">The fall also saw Ashley traveling to San  Francisco to see many of her old college friends. Highlights include seeing the  debut of &ldquo;American Idiot&rdquo; (now on Broadway) with her friend Paul, bumming  around and vintage clothes shopping with her friend Rachel, eating pho with  Betsy and Pat, and conquering the hills of San Francisco with her running  buddy, Dana. She also spent time behind bars -- at Alcatraz!</li>

      <li class="story style16">Well, we have another party planner in our midst! Ashley, who has been working at the <a href="http://www.heinzctr.org/">Heinz Center</a> in Washington on environmental issues, was the organizer of a big benefit on May 5, A Toast to Tom Lovejoy, their Biodiversity Chair. The event was a big smash: the master of ceremonies was Chevy Chase, and attendees included Tom Brokaw, Raffi, and a list of who's who. Ashley, with her typical panache for dress, had the brainstorm of having everyone wear bowties. Below is a picture of her  with Tom Brokaw (blue bow ties and cum(m)erbunds) and some other Heinz Center Staff.</li>

Amy was planning to be there for the great event: Azure was due on Ted's birthday, June 18. But little Azure couldn't wait. He decided he didn't want to share birthdays with his father (June 18), grandfather Roger (June 14) or cousin Grace (June 20), but wanted a birthday of his own. So he claimed JUNE 5. Happy Birthday to Azure. And congrats to Jaymie and Ted. For more pictures,<a href="Azure/AzureBirth.htm" class="style20"> click here</a>.</li>
      <li class="story style16">After 19 good years at Temple Law School, Amy has finally been tempted to leave, getting an offer she could not refuse from the new <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/law" target="_blank" class="style17">Drexel Law School,</a> where good friend and former colleague Roger Dennis (a/k/a &quot;the other Roger&quot;) is the new Dean. A new challenge -- and when you want a change, changing jobs is easier than changing husbands! But, as might be expected, between Temple and Drexel, she is spending a lot of time with her new grandson in Hawaii. </li>
      <li class="story style16">Another  new beginning.&nbsp; Having completed her  associate degree at Community College of Philadelphia, Hillaria began studies  at Temple University.&nbsp; Regrettably, it  was after Amy had left!</li>
      <li class="story style16">Ashley, now living DC and working with the Heinz Center, was on the road during July. First to London to visit li'l nephew Rupert, then on to Bosnia, where she is worked as a volunteer camp counselor at a camp organized by the Global Children's Organization.</li>
      <li class="story style16">Ashley attended an ICC Conference with Roger at Princeton. Our friend Enid was kind enough to document the visit for us:<br>

      <li class="story style16">2007 was a jam packed year: we added two new surnames and one new degree. The BossClarkDilgardClark family (which is really the BossClarkReynoldsMacLeanDilgardClark family) has become the BossClarkReynoldsMacLeanDilgardClarkConwayLewis clan. Phew!</li>
      <li class="story style16">On April 7, Melissa wedded Hamish Conway in a lovely ceremony in Christchurch. The entire BossClark family headed DownUnder for the big do: Amy, Roger, Ashley and Rupert did the weekend turnaround for which we are famous; Carolyne, Seymour and Philip spent a day or two more. Ted and Jaymie took a more leisurely and sane approach so Ted could show Jaymie his grandparents' home and the park where both he and his father played on Anzac Parade in Wanganui. </li>
      <li class="story style16">August 4 took the clan (including the extended Boss family) to Hawaii to see Ted wed his long-time love Jaymie Lewis in front of the Waimea Waterfalls on the North Shore of Oahu. The celebration (and it was some celebration) commemorated the nineth anniversary of the day they met: when Ted picked up a hitchhiker on his way to a Phish concert!

They both continue to make wonderful progress. <a href="http://www.wcco.com/video/?id=14955@wcco.dayport.com" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a short newscast about PKD featuring Gary and Mary!  More importantly, click here go to the PKD website and sponsor Mary and Gary in their annual walk to raise money for the PKD Foundation.

    <h3><a name="2005"></a>2005 HIGHLIGHTS in the BossClarkDilgardClark Household:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ted had a solo show of his glasswork in October at the Viscosity Gallery in Seattle, Washington. </li>
      <li>July saw the BossClark Household teaming up with the LewisStartzman
          household. Roger, Amy, Ashley and Ted joined up with Jaymie, her mom
          Deb, her two sisters Michaela and Mariah, and their dad Mike for a wonderful
          week vacation in Ocean City. Not a very energetic time -- but wonderful
          to share it!</li>
      <li>Roger and Amy's forty Chinese students came to Philly for the summer
        -- and along with eight other Chinese scholars wer entertained at the
        BossClark house! <a href="images/ChinesePicnic.jpg" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a group photo!</li>
      <li>Roger and Amy spent the spring semester teaching in Temple's LLM program
        in Beijing. It was a fantastic time: in addition to lots of lecturing,
        they spent time with friends Tony and Susan Browne from NZ (Tony
        is now the New Zealand Ambassador to China) , and of course our dear
        friend LingLing Liu. For our pictures, <a href="China2005/index.htm">Click
        here</a>.</li>
      <li>Ted and Jaymie joined us for the last 18 days. We had a great time
        exploring Beijing, then trekked to <a href="China2005/tibet.htm">Tibet</a>,
        Sichuan (home of the giant panda), and <a href="China2005/Dunhuang.htm">Gansu</a> (home
        of the Gobi Desert). Got some great pictures -- click the destination
        to check them out!</li>
      <li>This summer, Ashley interned on Capitol Hill in DC  for <a href="http://www.house.gov/andrews/">Congressman
        Rob Andrews</a>. What a great experience!</li>
      <li>Waitangi Day 2005 was a roaring success; Amy and Roger returned
          from New Zealand specifically for the event (since they had been warned
          that people were going to hold the party as usual whether or not the
          travelers deigned to show up). This year, the crowd on the steps (a.k.a.
          Ashley's crowd) took some great pictures. <a href="WaitangiDay/WaitangiDay2005.htm">Click
          here</a> to see them!</li>
      <li>Amy and Roger finished up their semester stay in New Zealand with another
        grand tour. The other Roger (aka Dennis) and Debbie joined them for two
        weeks exploring the South Island and part of the North. </li>
      <li>Ash and her crowd spent their spring vacation on Saint Thomas. How
        did they pull that off? </li>
      <li>Seymour and Carolyne have been traveling as well, the latest destination
        being Puerto Rico. </li>
      <li>Carolyne joined the <a href="http://www.dechert.com" target="_top">Dechert law firm</a>,  were she is currently working in the corporate department. Check out <a href="http://www.dechert.com/lawyers/lawyers.jsp?pg=detail&id=6214" target="_blank">her listing</a> at the firm!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="2004"></a>2004 HIGHLIGHTS  in the BossClark Household</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ted and Jaymie graduated from Evergreen State College in June. <a href="EvergreenGraduation2004.htm">Pictures</a>.</li>
      <li> Carolyne graduated from Rutgers Law School in May, receiving her degree from Roger. <a href="Australia2004/CarolyneGraduation/CarolyneGraduation.htm">More pictures</a>.</li>
      <li> Rupert graduated from Victoria University in Wellington -- the 3rd
        generation (after Roger and Melissa) to do so (Roger was there for it)
        . Rupert's father, Malcolm, completed his PhD at the University of
        Queensland in Brisbane. Rupert, Amy and Roger joined Malcolm's father
        and sister at the graduation</li>
      <li> Ashley finished her first year at Middlebury College, took intensive
        French over the summer, and traveled to Istanbul (see her <a href="Turkey2004/index.htm">Turkey pictures</a>).</li>
      <li> Hillaria gave birth to Aviv Goodgame Sprinkle on March 6, 2004</li>
      <li>Grace graduated from City Kids pre-school and began school at Marsden
        School. Click here to see <a href="Grace/index.htm">Grace's Page</a></li>
      <li>Roger finally made it to Samoa -- where he was treated like royalty!
        Indeed, the Prime Minister gave a formal dinner in his honor and presented
        him with his own kava bowl (not that Roger will drink the stuff). Roger
        and Amy climbed Mt Vaea in Apia to visit the grave of Robert Louis Stevenson.
        Check out the <a href="Samoa/index.htm">Samoa
        pictures! </a></li>
      <li>The visit to Samoa allowed Roger to yet another country to his list
        of &quot;countries I have run in&quot;. Also added in 2004 were Thailand and Costa
        Rica.</li>
      <li>The new hit theatre production <em>Sniper </em>in which Rupert had
        a part received the Chapman Tripp Theatre Award for New Zealand's <a href="NewZealand2004/Rupert.htm">most
        original production of the year</a>! </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="2004Reunions"></a>2004 REUNIONS </h3>
    <p>This year has been a big one for reunions! Amy returned to Bryn Mawr College
      for her 35th reunion (BMC &quot;clusters&quot; its classes so it's actually
      one year off!). And even better, she and three of her roommates from senior
      year had an informal reunion in Ocean City -- the first time the four had
      been together since graduation.</p>
    <p>Roger returned to Wanganui to celebrate Wanganui East Primary School's
      100th anniversary, where he met up with many of his classmates from the
      1940s. And in October, Roger and Amy attended Roger's 40th law school reunion
      in Wellington: dinner at Bellamy's (the dining room of Parliament), followed
      by a dim sum lunch the next day. Eighteen of the thirty-five members of
      the 1964 graduating class were at the event.</p>
